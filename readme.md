# StoryScapes101 - Introduction to the StoryScapes platform
-----------

This course curriculum includes modules, each with three lessons. The course can be executed comfortably over three days or compressed into two. Lessons and Modules are cumulative and should be completed in sequence.

### Course Modules

+ [x] Module 1 - Conveying Intelligence with StoryScapes
+ [x] Module 2 - Composing StoryScapes 1.0
+ [x] Module 3 - Collecting StoryLayer Data
+ [x] Module 4 - Curating StoryLayer Data
+ [x] Module 5 - Composing StoryScapes 2.0
+ [x] Module 6 - Collaboration & Community Building with StoryScapes

### Course Goals

This course was designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the StoryScapes platform to geoint professionals. Those who complete the course should feel comfortable integrating StoryScapes
into a range of geoint tasks, from managing and visualizing spatio-temporal data to adding analytical nuance to data that supports decision-making.

### Course Architecture

Since StoryScapes is a platform that is constantly improving and dedicated to openness and collaboration, this course was also designed with these attributes in mind.

Course modules are updated regularly using a simple markdown syntax and hosted on Github. After updates in Github, PDF versions of the Modules are rendered using `PanDoc`and made available for download at the StoryScapes `Get Started` page, where video tutorials complimenting the Modules are also available.

This Course architecture has a number of benefits, including:
- Course instructors can run a course with no software dependencies. All an instructor or course participant need is a laptop and internet connection.
- New StoryScapes users who don't have access to a formal course can follow a self-taught model by working through Modules and video tutorials on the StoryScapes `Get Started` page.
- Course writers can quickly and easily make updates to Modules as the StoryScapes platform evolves. The widely used Markdown syntax is easy to use, enabling new course writers to quickly get up to speed to make contributions.
- Markdown is a language that can easily be transformed into other formats.
- Course participants and instructors can easily provide feedback using Github issues.

### Module Design

Each of the six course Modules has three lessons. The course as eighteen individual lessons in all.

Each course lesson follows a three-part sequence: Listen>Watch>Do. The Listen/Watch/Do mehodology is a common learning methodology. It moves the learner through a process of hearing or reading new concepts, which they retain bits of, to watching someone apply concepts in practice, which they return more of, to finally applying the practice themselves, which they retain even more of.

Each course Module ends with a series of discussion questions that participants should engage in with colleagues before continuing on to the next Module.

### Course Style Guide

Each lesson within the module begins with a lesson title.

+ Lesson titles are always size Header 1 `# GST 10X - Course Title` and are the only size
Header 1 in the lab document.

The Lesson Objective is described next.

An attribution block is next as we always want to give proper attribution.

+ This Markdown document contains the attribution block:
[Attribution Block for Lab Documents.md][5].
+ Lab number and titles are always size Header 2

Next, Lecture, Demo and Task content is provided.

+ These three sections are always size Header 3.

The last two sections of the Module are Conclusion and Questions.

+ These two sections are always size Header 3 `### Conclusion`.

When an image is placed in the lesson document, the image is never provided a number,
instead, it is referred to by its relative placement to the referring text (ex.
refer to image below).  *All images should be placed within the 'images' folder
in the same directory as the Markdown document.
