## Introduction

In this module, students will learn to use StoryScapes as a platform to support project that are larger than what they can implement alone, including Community Initiatives, Organization Accounts and Open-Source Feature Enhancements.

This module includes the following lessons:

+	Lesson 1 – Organizing Community Initiatives
+	Lesson 2 – Managing Organization Accounts
+	Lesson 3 – Help StoryScapes Improve

Each lesson is planned to take about XXXX minutes to complete. Combined, this module should take XXX hours to complete (assuming ten minute breaks between each Lesson).


## Lesson 1: Organizing Community Initiatives
##### Objective
In this lesson, students will learn to start and lead a Community Initiative.
### Lecture

A Community Initiative is an effort by a group of StoryScapes users to collect StoryLayer data and compose StoryScapes around a common theme.

For example, when the ISIS movement gained prominence in 2014, a Community Initiative in StoryScapes could have helped analysts across the US Government quickly collect the spatio-temporal data available about ISIS into a single Community Initiative page. As the data accrued, analysts could quickly compose StoryScapes that help explain various phenomena apparent in the StoryLayer data.

##### The Community Initiative Page

Community Initiatives are hosted on a special account page inside StoryScapes. They can be accessed by going to the StoryScapes Explore page and filtering for Teams.

On the Community Initiative page you will see the StoryLayers and StoryScapes that are associated with the Community Initiative, as well as the Organizers and Members of the Community Initiative

##### Becoming an Community Initiative Organizer

If you have a Community Initiative you would like to see launched on StoryScapes, or that you would like to Organize yourself, you will need to email an administrator at XXXXX. An Administrator will then create the Community Initiative and add you as an Organizer. This will give you the ability to manage the Community Initiative page.

##### Managing a Community Initiative Page

Click "Manage" to customize basic information about your Community Initiative.

![SCREENSHOT](figures/Twopartsofthegeospatialdatamodel.png "Two parts of the geospatial data model")

To add StoryLayers and StoryScapes to your Community Initiative page, you simply go to the StoryLayer or StoryScape page. You will see an option to add the content to the Community Initiative that you are an Organizer for.

![SCREENSHOT](figures/Twopartsofthegeospatialdatamodel.png "Two parts of the geospatial data model")

StoryScapes users can also request to become Members of your Community Initiative. This is simply a way for you to indicate people that are supportive of your Community Initiative and helping with the work in some way. A user can request to become a Member. You can accept or reject these requests from the management page for the Community Initiative.

### Demonstration

Now that you've learned how to manage a Community Initiative, let's watch an example of a user performing these actions:

### Tasks

Now it's your turn!

- [x] First, find a Community Initiative on the Explore page and request to become a Member
- [x] Second, log off from your current account and log back on to StoryScapes using this test account - XXXX XXXX. This account is an Organizer for the XXXX Community Initiative. Go to this Community Initiative and make one improvement to the profile.
- [x] Third, add at least one StoryLayer or StoryScape to the XXXX Community Initiative.
- [x] Finally, do you have an idea for a Community Initiative? If so, send an email to XXXX. Maybe after you complete this course, the idea will become a reality!

## Lesson 2: Managing Organization Accounts
##### Objective
In this lesson, students will learn how to manage an Organization Account in StoryScapes.

### Lecture
Organization Accounts are very similar in structure to Community Initiative pages, although they have slightly different purposes. Community Initiatives are designed to promote collaboration around a single thematic content area that is pertinent for a period of time. Organization Accounts are designed for work units like agencies, teams, offices, departments and companies that benefit from a single place to represent their collective work on StoryScapes. For example, a regional desk inside the State Department may manage an Organization Account to host all of the StoryLayers and StoryScapes it produces over time.

Organization accounts are hosted on a special account page inside StoryScapes. They can be accessed by going to the StoryScapes Explore page and filtering for Teams.

On the Organization Account page you will see the StoryLayers and StoryScapes that are associated with the Organization, as well as the Organizers and Members of the Organization.

##### Setting up an Organization Account

When you are ready to set up an Organization Account for your work unit, simply email an administrator at XXXXX. An Administrator will work with you, or the appropriate point of contact to get the Organization Account created. Once this is done, this will give you, or the appropriate point of contact, the ability to manage the Organization account.

##### Managing an Organization Account

click "Manage" to customize basic information about your Organization Account.

To add StoryLayers and StoryScapes to your Organization page, you simply go to the StoryLayer or StoryScape page. You will see an option to add the content to the Organization that you are an Organizer for.

![SCREENSHOT](figures/Twopartsofthegeospatialdatamodel.png "Two parts of the geospatial data model")

StoryScapes users can also request to become Members of your Organization. This is simply a way for you to indicate people that are involved in your Organization.

### Tasks

Now it's your turn!

- [x] First, find an Organization Account on the Explore page and request to become a Member
- [x] Second, log off from your current account and log back on to StoryScapes using this test account - XXXX XXXX. This account is an Organizer for the XXXX Organization Account Go to this Organization page and make one improvement to the profile.
- [x] Third, add at least one StoryLayer or StoryScape to the XXXX Organization Account.
- [x] Finally, do you have an idea for an Organization Account? If so, send an email to XXXX. Maybe after you complete this course, the idea will become a reality!

## Lesson 3: Help StoryScapes Improve
##### Objective
In this lesson, students will learn how they can help make StoryScapes a platform that continuously improves to better serve its user community.
### Lecture

StoryScapes is designed to be a community-driven piece of software, more like Wikipedia than Microsoft Word. StoryScapes is a knowledge platform where users work together to make the StoryLayers and StoryScapes that are published more complete and accurate over time.

StoryScapes users also have an opportunity to help improve the platform itself. If you have an interest or ability to go above and beyond to help StoryScapes improve, consider the following four actions:

###### Report Issues

As you use the StoryScapes platform, you can report any issues you experience. XXXX

###### Contribute to the Roadmap

StoryScapes development follows a Roadmap that is available here XXXX. If you have ideas for features you want to see built, contribute it to the Roadmap XXXX.

###### Write Code

If you're a software developer, you're invited to get involved in the StoryScapes development pipeline. StoryScapes develops on a Agile process anchored by an open Scrub Board. Read more about our process here XXX. Check out our Backlog of issues here XXX. If there is one you feel you can tackle, go ahead!

##### Apply to become an Administrator

Administrators are the glue that holds StoryScapes together. Administrators are StoryScapes users that have demonstrated significant experience and skill in using StoryScapes and are willing to volunteer time above and beyond their work duties to help make StoryScapes succeed. Administrators take on tasks like:

+ Responding to content Flags
+ Responding to Community Initiative and Organization Account requests
+ Featuring excellent content on the Homepage
+ Setting development priorities for the Roadmap

If you are interested in becoming a StoryScapes Administrator, email XXXX. XXXXX

### Demonstration

Take a few minutes to listen to XXXX, a long-time StoryScapes developer, discuss what its like to be a StoryScapes developer and administrator;

Watch this video. VIDEO.

### Tasks

Now that you've reached this final lesson in the Course, we want your thoughts! Take a moment to think about a new feature that you'd like to see in StoryScapes. Maybe its a new tool to help you curate StoryLayers or compose StoryScapes. Contribute your idea to the StoryScapes Roadmap!

## Conclusion

In this Module you have learned how you can use StoryScapes to bring people together, whether its bringing users together around a common interest in the form of a Community Initiative, or its bringing users together that work on the same time through an Organization Account.

You've also learned that StoryScapes depends on its users to step up in order to succeed. You've been invited to provide feedback, write code and even to become a site Administrator. The future of StoryScapes depends on you! Join us to chart the future!
