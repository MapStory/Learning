## Introduction

This Instructor Guide is designed for individuals who are teaching the StoryScapes101 course, either virtually or in-person.

This Guide includes the following sections:

+	Section 1 – Overview of Course & Instructor Requirements
+ Section 2 – Instructors Notes
+	Section 3 – Introductory Slides to begin the course

## Section 1: Overview of Course & Instructor Requirements

Before determining whether this course is something you feel willing and able to instruct, please review the following information.

### Overview of Course

This course was designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the StoryScapes platform to geoint professionals. Those who complete the course should feel comfortable integrating StoryScapes
into a range of geoint tasks, from managing and curating spatio-temporal data to publishing data-rich spatial narratives that support decision-making.

This course curriculum is designed around six modules, each with three lessons. Lessons and Modules are cumulative and should be completed in sequence.

#### Course Modules & Lessons

Each of the six course modules have three lessons. The course has eighteen individual lessons in all.

Each lesson follows a two-part sequence: Listen, then do. This methodology moves learners through a process of hearing or reading new concepts to putting them into practice.

Each course module ends with a series of discussion questions that participants should reflect on individually or in conversation with colleagues before continuing on to the next Module.

### Instructor Requirements

To successfully facilitate this course, Instructors should have _at minimum_ the following capacities:

- Have enough experience with geospatial data to inspect pre-prepared data in a GIS software (such as QGIS or ArcMap), and save these data as a zipped file.
- Have enough experience with the StoryScapes platform to execute and answer questions about all of its core functions, including:
  - Creating and managing individual, Community Initiative, and Organization profiles
  - Importing new .csv and .shp file datasets as Storylayers
  - Curating and editing StoryLayers
  - Composing and publishing StoryScapes using simple, unique, choropleth and graduated styling and StoryPins and StoryFrames
  - Using search to find content and using published content to convey meaning in presentations
- Have access to the StoryScapes platform and/or a training version of the platform
  - *_Note, ideally the instructor will have access to Organizer status for an Initiative and Organization account so that learners can practice managing these accounts, as outlined in Module 6_
- Have access to the test data that supports the lessons. Test data is available in the Data Folder on the Github repository - https://github.com/MapStory/Learning. If test data is not available, the instructor can use their own.

## Section 2 – Instructor Notes

These notes are intended to provide helpful guidance to an instructor _as they are teaching_ the course.

### Get Started

Section 3 of this Module provides some introductory slides that an instructor can display on a screen before switching to the course Modules.

Show the pdf document for these introductory slides in Full Screen Mode. In most pdf viewers (i.e. Acrobat) this can be done in the `View` menu at the top of your screen. You may need to zoom in on the view so the text shows up in the size appropriate to your room and screen situation.

Slide transitions will be noted by a Slide number.

Once you have completed these Introductory slides you can switch to displaying the Module pdf documents on the screen and scrolling through them as you instruct the class. Learners should also have the Module pdfs downloaded and thus be able to view them locally on their own machines. This combination provides the class an opportunity to follow the content in common while also going back and forth in content as they need to tailor their learning.

### Prerequisites

Before digging into course content, make sure to set learner expectations and welcome them to the space and the course. Here are some things to consider:

_Space Prerequisites_

- Ensure your computer and projector screen are operating
- Ensure the room has sufficient tables and seats for your expected class size
- Ensure the room has working wireless internet, and that you know the password, if required
- Locate bathrooms so you can let learners know where they are
- Make sure the room has sufficient charging plugs so that learners can keep their computers charged throughout the course.

_Learner Prequisites_

- All learners should have access to a personal computer with access to the internet.
- Learners' computers should have _at minimum_ access to a program for working with tabular data that can produce comma-separated files, such as Microsoft Excel. Ideally, learners will also have access to a GIS software program that can produce Shapefiles, such as ArcMap or QGIS.
- Learners should have authorization credentials to log in to the StoryScapes platform or the Instructor should be able to provide learners access to a training version of StoryScapes.
- Learners should have access to the test data required for the lessons and/or similar types of data of their own to use during activities.

### Course Agenda

Make sure to cover the agenda you have outlined for the course, including start and end times, breaks, and order of the learning. The curriculum outline is as follows:

### Course Materials

Before beginning Module 1, let the learners know how to access course materials.

First, direct them to where they can download the Module and Lesson materials. This will require directing learners to the StoryScapes platform that they will be using during the course. If this is an open access training site, learners will not need to log-in to StoryScapes to access the Module and Lessons materials at the `Get Started` page. If this is a closed password-protected version of StoryScapes, you will have to spend the time to get learners logged in to the site.

Learners should download the pdfs for all six Modules at the outset, so you can confirm learners have access to the learning material for the whole course before diving in.

Second, learners should go ahead and download the test data that will be used in the Modules. Doing this at the outset of the class will help surface any issues learners may have right away, before you get too far in the course.

### The mission of StoryScapes

Make sure to introduce learners to the overall mission of StoryScapes:

_StoryScapes is a collaborative platform that makes spatio-temporal knowledge easy to find, improve, and share in order to drive evidence-based decision-making anytime and anywhere._

### The "4 C's" of StoryScapes

Make sure to introduce learners to the four critical user actions (the '4 C's) that StoryScapes is designed around. These are:

1. Collecting data (or 'StoryLayers')
2. Curating Storylayers
3. Composing StoryScapes
4. Conveying intelligence

This graphic is helpful in discussing the concrete user personas that take up these actions:
