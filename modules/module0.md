## Introduction

This Instructor Guide is designed for individuals who are teaching the StoryScapes101 course, either virtually or in-person.

This Guide includes the following sections:

+	Section 1 – Overview of Course & Instructor Requirements
+ Section 2 – Instructors Notes that correspond to course content and can be used to support instruction.
+	Section 3 – Introductory Slides to begin the course

## Section 1: Overview of Course & Instructor Requirements

Before determining whether this course is something you feel willing and able to instruct, please review the following information.

### Overview of Course

This course was designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the StoryScapes platform to geoint professionals. Those who complete the course should feel comfortable integrating StoryScapes
into a range of geoint tasks, from managing and curating spatio-temporal data to publishing data-rich spatial narratives that support decision-making.

This course curriculum is designed around six modules, each with three lessons. Each module is designed to take about two hours. The course can be executed comfortably over three days or compressed into two. Learners completing the material online or independently should allow about twelve hours to complete.

Lessons and Modules are cumulative and should be completed in sequence.

#### Course Modules & Lessons

Each of the six course modules have three lessons. The course has eighteen individual lessons in all.

Each lesson follows a three-part sequence: Listen>Watch>Do. The Listen>Watch>Do methodology moves learners through a process of hearing or reading new concepts, which they retain bits of, watching someone apply concepts in practice, which they retain more of, and finally applying the practice themselves, which they retain even more of.

Each course module ends with a series of discussion questions that participants should reflect on individually or in conversation with colleagues before continuing on to the next Module.

#### Course Architecture

Since StoryScapes is a platform that is constantly improving and dedicated to openness and collaboration, this course was also designed with these attributes in mind.

Course modules are updated regularly using a simple markdown syntax and hosted on Github. PDF versions of the Modules are rendered using `PanDoc`and made available for download at the StoryScapes `Get Started` page, where video tutorials complimenting the Modules are also available.

This Course architecture has a number of benefits, including:
- Course instructors can run a course with no software dependencies. All an instructor or course participant needs is a laptop and internet connection.
- New StoryScapes users who don't have access to a formal in-person course can follow a self-taught model by working through Modules and video tutorials on the StoryScapes `Get Started` page.
- Course writers can quickly and easily make updates to Modules as the StoryScapes platform evolves. The widely used Markdown syntax is easy to use, enabling new course writers to quickly get up to speed to make contributions.
- Markdown is a language that can easily be transformed into other formats.
- Course participants and instructors can easily provide feedback using Github issues.

Therefore, when teaching this course, you as the instructor will utilize the videos and downloadable pdf documents available on the StoryScapes `Get Started` page.

### Instructor Requirements

To successfully facilitate this course, Instructors should have _at minimum_ the following capacities:

- Have enough experience with geospatial data to inspect pre-prepared data in a GIS software (such as QGIS or ArcMap), and save these data as a zipped file.
- Have enough experience with the StoryScapes platform to execute and answer questions about all of its core functions, including:
  - Creating and managing individual, Community Initiative, and Organization profiles
  - Importing new .csv and .shp file datasets as Storylayers
  - Curating and editing StoryLayers
  - Composing and publishing StoryScapes using simple, unique, choropleth and graduated styling and StoryPins and StoryFrames
  - Using search to find content and using published content to convey meaning in presentations
- Have access to the StoryScapes platform and/or a training version of the platform
  - *_Note, ideally the instructor will have access to Organizer status for an Initiative and Organization account so that learners can practice managing these accounts, as outlined in Module 6_
- Have access to the test data that supports lessons around collecting and importing data in Module 3.

## Section 2 – Instructor Notes

These notes are intended to provide helpful guidance to an instructor _as they are teaching_ the course.

### Get Started

Section 3 of this Module provides some introductory slides that an instructor can display on a screen before switching to the course Modules.

Show the pdf document for these introductory slides in Full Screen Mode. In most pdf viewers (i.e. Acrobat) this can be done in the `View` menu at the top of your screen. You may need to zoom in on the view so the text shows up in the size appropriate to your room and screen situation.

Slide transitions will be noted by a Slide number.

Once you have completed these Introductory slides you can switch to displaying the Module pdf documents on the screen and scrolling through them as you instruct the class. Learners should also have the Module pdfs downloaded and thus be able to view them locally on their own machines. This combination provides the class an opportunity to follow the content in common while also going back and forth in content as they need to tailor their learning.

### Prerequisites

Before digging into course content, make sure to set learner expectations and welcome them to the space and the course. Here are some things to consider:

_Space Prerequisites_

- Ensure your computer and projector screen are operating
- Ensure the room has sufficient tables and seats for your expected class size
- Ensure the room has working wireless internet, and that you know the password, if required
- Locate bathrooms so you can let learners know where they are
- Make sure the room has sufficient charging plugs so that learners can keep their computers charged throughout the course.

_Learner Prequisites_

- All learners should have access to a personal computer with access to the internet on a supported browser (XXXX).
- Learners' computers should have _at minimum_ access to a program for working with tabular data that can produce comma-separated files, such as Microsoft Excel. Ideally, learners will also have access to a GIS software program that can produce Shapefiles, such as ArcMap or QGIS
- Learners should have authorization credentials to log in to the StoryScapes platform _or_ the Instructor should be able to provide learners access to a training version of StoryScapes.

### Course Agenda

Make sure to cover the agenda you have outlined for the course, including start and end times, breaks, and order of the learning. The curriculum outline is as follows:

### Course Materials

Before beginning Module 1, let the learners know how to access course materials.

First, direct them to where they can download the Module and Lesson materials. This will require directing learners to the StoryScapes platform that they will be using during the course. If this is an open access training site, learners will not need to log-in to StoryScapes to access the Module and Lessons materials at the `Get Started` page. If this is a closed password-protected version of StoryScapes, you will have to spend the time to get learners logged in to the site.

Learners should download the pdfs for all six Modules at the outset, so you can confirm learners have access to the learning material for the whole course before diving in.

Second, learners should go ahead and download the test data that will be used in Module 3 focused on collecting StoryLayer data. Doing this at the outset of the class will help surface any issues learners may have right away, before you get too far in the course. If learners have access to the internet, these test data can be accessed from Github (XXXX). If learners do not have access to the open internet, you will have to bring the test data pre-loaded to a flash drive.

### The mission of StoryScapes

Make sure to introduct learners to the overall mission of StoryScapes:

_StoryScapes is a collaborative platform that makes spatio-temporal knowledge easy to find, improve, and share in order to drive evidence-based decision-making anytime and anywhere._

### The "4 C's" of StoryScapes

Make sure to introduce learners to the four critical user actions (the '4 C's) that StoryScapes is designed around. These are:

1. Collecting data (or 'StoryLayers')
2. Curating Storylayers
3. Composing StoryScapes
4. Conveying intelligence

This graphic is helpful in discussing the concrete user personas that take up these actions:

### Module 1

#### Lesson 1: Build a Profile

This lesson is primarily about getting your learners successfully logged into StoryScapes. Building a Profile is very straightforward. Anyone that has built a user profile on popular social platforms (i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook) will find this process in StoryScapes to be familiar. If no one has problems accessing the StoryScapes platform, this Lesson could be completed fairly quickly. However, expect at least one of your learners to have problems at some stage in the process. It is best to take your time and make sure everyone is logged in with a user profile before proceeding further.

#### Lesson 2: Search and Share

The most important aspect of this lesson is to establish the terminology that StoryScapes utilizes. StoryScapes does rely on unique terms, and it is important that learners have an understanding of what is being referred to when you use terms like StoryLayer or StoryScape. Take your time here and allow learners to ask questions and confirm for you that they are getting a sense of these terms.


#### Lesson 3 Present with StoryScapes

This lesson will be most interesting for the learner if you as the instructor have a StoryScape in mind that you can use as an example to present with. The isn't a requirement. You can teach the Lesson by simply following the text and figures in the lesson and then watching the Demonstration video. But, if possible try taking some time to find a published StoryScape created by yourself or another user and walk through the playback features on this live demonstration!

### Module 2

For the lessons in this module to work, you will need to have at least one StoryLayer pre-loaded on the StoryScapes platform you are using for the training. Ideally you will have several StoryLayers to work with - including at least one with points and one with polygons.

#### Lesson 1: Setting Up a StoryScape

This lesson uses a pre-set example. If you would like to demonstration with a different StoryScape, feel free!

#### Lesson 2: Adding and Styling StoryLayers

This lesson uses a metaphor of pizza to try and describe how the structural components of a StoryScape work together, with StoryLayers at the base and StoryPins and StoryFrames added on top to enhance the narrative. If another metaphor comes to mind that feels more appropriate for you, feel free to amend.

If your learners have prior experience with GIS workflows, introducing them to map styling might be an easier task. This lessson is written assuming learners have no prior experience.

#### Lesson 3: Adding simple StoryPins and StoryFrames

By the end of this lesson, we've asked learners to have composed a full story with styled StoryLayers, a StoryPin and a StoryFrame. Emphasize to your learners that their story doesn't need to be _coherent_. The goal here is to walk through the motions involved in composing a StoryScape. All of the content they are creating can be deleted after the training is concluded.

### Module 3

#### Lesson 1: Importing point StoryLayers
#### Lesson 2: Importing polygon StoryLayers
#### Lesson 3: Creating StoryLayers from scratch

### Module 4

#### Lesson 1: Peer Reviewing StoryLayers
#### Lesson 2: Editing StoryLayer geometries
#### Lesson 3: Editing Storylayer attributes

### Module 5

#### Lesson 1: Using Choropleth and Graduated styling for StoryLayers

This lesson's task asks learners to apply choropleth and graduated styles. To do that, you will need to make sure the StoryScapes platform you're using for the training has at least one point StoryLayer and one polygon StoryLayer loaded. The github repository for the course has these test datasets avaiable for download in case you need them.

#### Lesson 2: Using Icons Commons for point Storylayers

The test data folder of the Github repo has a couple of .svg files that you can share with learners, or use yourself in your lecture.

#### Lesson 3: Adding StoryPins with Media

_TBD based on workflow for embedding media_

### Module 6

#### Lesson 1: Organizing Community Initiatives

While this lesson can be implemented using only the text and figures from the lesson document, it will be greatly enhanced if you as an instructor have Organizer status on a Community Initiative and thus can provide a live demonstration of the management functions for Community Initiatives.

#### Lesson 2: Managing Organization Accounts

While this lesson can be implemented using only the text and figures from the lesson document, it will be greatly enhanced if you as an instructor have Organizer status on an Organization and thus can provide a live demonstration of the management functions for Organization pages.

#### Lesson 3: Help StoryScapes Improve

_TBD based on administrator workflow_
