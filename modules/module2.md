## Introduction

In this Module, students will learn the basics of using the StoryScapes `Composer`. By the end of the Module students will have published a simple StoryScape using StoryLayers imported by others.


This module includes the following lessons:

+	Lesson 1 – Setting Up a StoryScape
+	Lesson 2 – Adding and Styling StoryLayers
+	Lesson 3 – Adding simple StoryPins and StoryFrames

Each Lesson is planned to take about 30 minutes to complete. Combined, this module should take two hours to complete (assuming ten minute breaks between each Lesson).


## Lesson 1: Setting Up a StoryScape
##### Objective

In this Lesson students will learn how to plan for and begin composing a StoryScape.

### Lecture

##### The Principles of a StoryScape

A “StoryScape” is a specific type of story that seeks to explain phenomena as they occur over space and time.

Thus, like all story forms, a StoryScape includes the following four elements: place, plot, performers and a point. Whenever you are viewing or composing a StoryScape, you should ask yourself four questions:

- What _places_ are involved in this StoryScape?
- What is the _plot_ of this StoryScape?
- Who or what are the _performers_ in this StoryScape?
- What is the _point_ of this StoryScape?

Let's look a bit closer and what we mean by place, plot, performer and point:

- **Place**: Traditional story definitions will refer instead of place to “setting”, since a story obviously doesn’t have to occur in geographic context. We spend most of our time in James Joyce’s Ulysses exploring consciousness, for example. For a StoryScape, however, setting always refers to place in a literal sense. StoryScapes always occur _somewhere_.
- **Plot**: Plot refers to what happens in a story, and in what order. StoryScapes should always have a plot. They are not simply a graph or chart that presents data. They unfold over time in a sequence specifically designed to convey a particular perspective.
- **Performers**: For events to occur, there must be action. And for action to occur, there must be performers. In a StoryScape, performers could be humans or animals, or even plant life like an invasive species, or an environmental force like a hurricane.
- **Point** Every StoryScape has a point, or main theme. This is also often referred to as a story's theme or main idea. Sometimes the StoryTeller makes this point very explicit. Othertimes, the StoryTeller may leave it to viewers to infer the main point implicitly conveyed in the StoryScape.

##### The Components of a StoryScape

All stories are made up of small components that combine into a coherent whole. For a StoryScape, these elements include styled StoryLayers, StoryPins, StoryFames, description and metadata. Below we provide a brief definition of each of these components. Later we will gain a better understanding of these componets by _putting them to use_.

- **StoryLayer**: A StoryLayer is a data file that is used to display geographic information with temporal attribute(s)
- **StoryPin**: A StoryPin is a single geographic feature that is added to a StoryScape to convey qualitative information at a specific point in time in a StoryScape.
- **StoryFrame**: A StoryFrame defines the geographic bounds and zoom level of the map canvas during a defined period of time in the StoryScape.
- **Description**: Every StoryScape has various types of description, such as a summary and individual chapter descriptions.
- **Metadata**: Every StoryScape has various types of metadata, such as a Title, Category, and Tags.


##### The Process of Making a StoryScape
###### **First Steps**
To get started making your own StoryScape, first launch the StoryScapes composer by opening the `Create` dropdown from the top of your screen and clicking `Compose StoryScape`.

![](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 10.33.12 AM.jpg)\

You can also launch the StoryScape composer by going directly to a StoryLayer page and clicking "compose StoryScape". Using this link will launch the composer with that particular StoryLayer included in Chapter 1.

Once you enter the StoryScape composer, your first step is to give your StoryScape a title. A good StoryScape title is similar to a good book title. It should indicate what the StoryScape is about.

![](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 10.38.19 AM.jpg)\

In addition to a Title, you'll need to give your StoryScape a Summary. The Summary serves a similar purpose as article abstract. It describes what the StoryScape is about and why it is significant.

Finally, assign your StoryScape to one of the fixed Categories that most applies.

Don’t worry - you can change the Title, Summary and Category later.

##### Outlining Your StoryScape

Just like any piece of writing, it is a good idea to outline your StoryScape before proceeding too far. To outline your StoryScape consider the following:

+ Has someone already published a StoryScape similar to the one you envision? If so, think about how your StoryScape will make a unique contribution.
+ How many chapters will your StoryScape have? For example, a StoryScape about the American Civil War might have a chapters for each major battle - i.e. Bull Run, Gettysburg, Antietem).
+ Each chapter will need a Description of its own. This should be a paragraph or two that describes the chapter and its significance.
+ What StoryLayers will you use in each chapter? You'll need to search for StoryLayers to make sure they exist on the platform to use in your StoryScape. For example, a StoryScape about the American Civil War with chapters for different battles will need StoryLayers that depict aspects of these battles, such as the location of troop movements. If the StoryLayers you want for your StoryScape aren't already available, you'll need to import them yourself. We'll cover importing StoryLayers in Module 3.

### Demonstration

Now that you have an understanding about the what's involved in setting up a StoryScape, let's watch someone begin a new StoryScape:

Watch this video. VIDEO.

### Tasks

Now it's your turn! Your task is to start a new StoryScape:

- [x] Start a new StoryScape and give it a Title, Summary and Category
- [x] Create chapters and give each chapter a Summary
- [x] Save your StoryScape as a draft

## Lesson 2: Adding and Styling StoryLayers

##### Objective
In this lesson students will learn how to add StoryLayers to a StoryScape, and to apply Simple and Unique styles to StoryLayers.

### Lecture

##### Adding StoryLayers to a chapter

StoryLayers form the foundation of your Chapters. If a StoryScape is like a pizza, then the StoryLayers are like the crust. Everything else in a StoryScape (i.e. StoryPins and StoryFrames) sits on top of the StoryLayers. To add StoryLayers to your Chapter, click `Add StoryLayers`. A window will pop up where you can input StoryLayer titles. Click `use` to add the StoryLayer to your chapter.

![](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 10.46.31 AM.jpg)\

You can add multiple StoryLayers to each chapter. Once added, you can click and drag the StoryLayers to change the order of which one is sent to back or front.

Once a StoryLayer is added, you can control its visual appearance with styling. A Style refers to the color, hue and size associated with features in a StoryLayer. Each StoryLayer in StoryScapes has a default style applied to it to start. Once you create and save your own style, that style will appear on your StoryScape when it is published.

StoryScapes supports four types of styling:
- Simple
- Unique
- Choropleth
- Graduated

In this Module we will cover Simple and Unique styling only since they are the easiest to use. In Module 5 we will cover Choropleth and Graduated styling.

##### Applying Simple styling to a StoryScape

With a Simple style, all aspects (color, hue and size) are uniform on all features of the StoryLayer. This style is often used if features don't need to be differentiated from one another.

To add apply a Simple style to a StoryScape, follow these steps:

First, you will launch a new StoryScape, as you learned to do in the previous Lesson. To review, you should:
  - Click `Create` and `Compose StoryScape` at the top of your screen.
  - Give your new StoryScape a Title, a Summary and a Category.
  - Begin working on Chapter 1. Give Chapter 1 a name and enter a brief description.

Next, add a StoryLayer to Chapter 1.
- Click `Add a StoryLayer` and begin typing to trigger the auto-complete box for StoryLayer names. When the StoryLayer you're looking for appears, select it and click `Add`.

In the example below, we've added a StoryLayer depicting the total land controlled by ISIS during a particular period of time.

Now, in the left-hand sidebar of the composer, we see the name of the StoryLayer and green buttons where we can `Style` the StoryLayer, toggle its `Visibility` and `Delete` it from the StoryScape.

Click `Style` to open up the style editor. We want to select the `Simple` styling option. This will customize the set of tools in the style editor that are appropriate for a Simple style.

![](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 10.51.51 AM.jpg)\

For Simple styling, we see three sections in the style editor, for **Symbol**, **Stroke** and **Label**


_Under the `Symbol` header_:

- Select the color you want. In this example we've given the areas controlled by ISIS a blue color.
- If your StoryLayer is made of points, you can also select a size for the points. For polygon StoryLayers, there is no option to change the size.
- Select the Transparency level you want. This allows you to make the color more or less transaprent. 100% gives the feature full color. A lower percent of transparency makes it easier to see through the feature.
- Finally, for StoryLayers with points, you have the option to rotate the feature. This might be useful if your point symbol indicates direction somehow. *_Note, this will make more sense as a possibility when we introduce the Icons Commons in Module 5._

_Under the `Stroke` header_:

- Select the way you want the line surrounding your features (the `Stroke`) to be depicted. StoryScapes supports strokes that are `Solid`, `Dashed`, or `Dotted`. In the example solid is selected.
- Select the thickness (or `Weight`) for the stroke. In the example a stroke weight of 1 is selected.
- Select the `Color` for stroke. Here Blue is selected.
- Select the `Transparency` for the stroke. Here the transparency is 100.

_Under the `Label` header:_

- Select an attribute with text if you want that text to appear on the map as a label. If we had selected one, we could also customize the `Size`, `Font`, `Color` and `Style` of the font used by the label.

##### Applying Unique styling to a StoryScape

A Unique style allows you to represent features with a different color based on a category that the feature falls into. For example, perhaps your StoryLayer depicts trees that were cut down in a particular place at a particular point in time. Perhaps your StoryLayer data has an attribute for “Tree Type”. With Unique styling, you could present each Tree Type with its own color.

In the example below, we use Unique styling to differentiate between areas that ISIS counts as territory (blue) versus areas under attack by ISIS (orange)

![SCREENSHOT](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 10.56.03 AM.jpg)\

Here's how we were able to apply this Unique style

First, since we were already in the style editor of the composer, with the ISIS territorial control StoryLayer added to chapter 1, we switched from the `Simple` style option to the `Unique` styling option. This customized the set of tools in the style editor that are appropriate for a Unique. style.

The options for Unique are very similar to Simple, with a few differences. You will see sections for **Stroke** and **Label** that work the same as they do for Simple styling.

But, in Unique, you will see a new section called **Classification** that replaces the **Symbol** section we saw in Simple styling. The Classification section essentially wants to know which attribute in the StoryLayer you are going to use to break up the styling into unique color groups.

To repeat, in this example we use Unique styling to differentiate between two groups: 1) areas that ISIS counts as territory (blue) versus 2) areas under attack by ISIS (orange). In the StoryLayer data, the attribute that defines these different areas is called "Group". So, in the Classification section, we select "Group" from the drop-down.

We also select a color ramp. In this eample, we use the first color ramp. And we make sure the classification number is more than the number of unique groups we want to make. In this example we increase it to six just to be safe, but there are only two groups.

Once we've completed the Classification section, we see our unique groups listed under a new section called **Rules** at the bottom of the style editor. Default colors are applied to our groups which we can customize if we want.

### Demonstration

Now that you have an understanding about the what's involved in adding StoryLayers to a chapter and applying Simple and Unique styles to StoryLayers, let's watch someone build a new StoryScape.

Watch this video. VIDEO.

### Tasks
Now it's your turn! Return to the draft StoryScape you started building in Lesson 1. You should be able to find the saved draft by going to your Profile.

Now, add at least one StoryLayer to a chapter in your StoryScape. Change the color of all features in the StoryLayer by using Simple styling. Then, change the color of features based on an Attribute in the StoryLayer using the Unqiue Styling. Save your draft StoryScape.

## Lesson 3: Adding StoryPins and StoryFrames
##### Objective
In this lesson students will learn how to add basic Storypins and StoryFrames to their StoryScape in order to deepen their narrative.

### Lecture

StoryPins and StoryFrames are tools to help your StoryScape more clearly convey its plot and point. If a StoryScape is like a pizza, and StoryLayers are like the crust, we might say that StoryPins and StoryFrames are like the sauce and toppings.

 StoryFrames and StoryPins are the key ingredients for adding narrative richness to styled StoryLayers so that a real _story_ emerges. For example, in the previous Lesson we added a Unique style to a StoryLayer showing areas of ISIS control and attack. But this alone tells us little about _how_ or _why_ ISIS controls and/or attacks various territories. With StoryPins, we can highlight specific people and events that have made a difference. And with StoryFrames we can make sure to zoom into to key places where these events are happening, just like a filmmaker might zoom in during a scene to focus our attention.

##### Adding simple Storypins

StoryPins let you add more qualitative information that doesn't quite make sense as part of the StoryLayer data. For example, perhaps you want a pin with a newspaper article that was important, or you want to pin a video that helps explain what the viewer is seeing in your StoryScape. Or, maybe you just want to add some clarifying text that helps a viewer understand more about something at a specific moment in time.

In this lesson we will build StoryPins that only have text. In Module 5 we will build StoryPins with embedded media, like images and videos.

To create a StoryPin, navigate to the StoryPins tab in composer. This will open up a form for creating your StoryPins.

![](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 11.23.13 AM.jpg)\

There are two ways to create StoryPins:
1. one at a time
2. uploading several all at once with “bulk upload”

##### Adding StoryPins one at a time

To add StoryPins one at a time, click `New Storypin`. Click `Move Pin` and then click and drag the pin on the map to its desired location. You can also manually enter Latitude and Longitude coordinates into the form if you know them.

Next, give your Storypin a title and description. Then, define the start time that you want your StoryPin to appear at, and the end time that you want it to dissappear at.

In the example below, we've created a StoryPin to highlight the time and place where ISIS formally declared its Caliphate.

![](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 11.27.12 AM.jpg)\

##### Creating lots of StoryPins at once

To add lots of StoryPins at once, instead of clicking `New StoryPins`, you will click `Import` to download a blank .CSV file with pre-set column headers for the information you need to have for each StoryPin.

![SCREENSHOT](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 11.30.34 AM.jpg)\

Once you’ve populated the CSV with your StoryPin information, return to the composer and click `Import` and upload your StoryPins . All of your StoryPins will then appear individually in the StoryPin sidebar so that you can further customize them individually.

*_Note: Next to `Import` is an `Export` option where you can download StoryPin information into a .csv file._

##### Adding StoryFrames

StoryFrames give you an ability to control the geographic extent and zoom level on the map at various points in time in a chapter. For example, at the start of your chapter you may want a zoom level that shows the whole world. But part way through your chapter you may want the map to zoom in closer to a specific country, town or even an individual block. Every chapter can have as many StoryFrames as you want, although remember that too much zooming around on the map might make it hard for the viewer of your StoryScape to make sense of your StoryScape!

To create a StoryFrame, open up the StoryFrame form. Give your StoryFrame a brief title and description, just to help you remember your purpose for creating StoryFrame. StoryFrame titles and descriptions don't show up anywhere on your published StoryScape. Next, set your StoryFrame zoom level, and give your StoryFrame a start and end date.

Next, click `Create Bounding Box`. This will give you the directive to hold `Shift` while clicking and dragging a square frame on the map canvas at your desired geography and zoom level. When you are done, click `Add`. If you'd like to try drawing the frame again, click `Reset`.

In the example below, we've created a StoryFrame that better focuses on a location where ISIS declared a Caliphate, a point also highlighted with a StoryPin.

![SCREENSHOT](images/Screen Shot 2019-01-22 at 11.35.57 AM.jpg)\

### Demonstration

Now that you have an understanding about the what's involved in adding StoryPins and StoryFrames to a StoryScape, let's watch someone go through this process:

Watch this video. VIDEO.

### Tasks

Now it's your turn! Return to the draft StoryScape you've worked on in earlier lessons. Remember, you can access this draft StoryScape from your Profile. Add at least one StoryPin and one StoryFrame to a chapter. Save your draft StoryScape. Then hit "Publish" and watch your published StoryScape. Share the StoryScape link with a colleague so they can view it too. Ask them to confirm that your StoryScape includes the following elements:

- At least one Storylayer with a Simple or Unique style
- At least one StoryPin with text
- At least one storyFrame

## Conclusion

In this Module you have learned to how to set up a new StoryScape, add and style StoryLayers with Simple and Unique styling, and add simple text based StoryPins and StoryFrames.

With these skills, you can quickly and easily compose and publish a StoryScape that utilizes StoryLayers already imported to the StoryScapes platform. And, using the skills you built in Module 1, you can share your published StoryScape with colleagues and use it to strengthen your briefings and presentations.

In future Modules we will cover more advanced features in the StoryScapes composer, such as using complex styles on StoryLayers and adding media to StoryPins.

## Discussion Questions
Before moving on to the next Module, take fifteen minutes to reflect independently or in a group on the following questions:

1. In this Module you started building a StoryScape of your own. Why did you pick the topic you did to practice with?

2. Now that you have a better understanding of how the StoryScapes composer works, what is a StoryScape you'd like to try and work on in the future?

3. Can you think of other types of features that StoryScapes should work to incorporate that would help you compose the StoryScape you envision?

4. Can you think of topics that cannot be explained within a spatio-temporal framework like StoryScapes? If so, what other types of methods might you use to convey those topics?

5. What other comments, questions or concerns do you have about this Module?
