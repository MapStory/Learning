## Introduction

In this module, students will learn how to curate the completeness and accuracy of StoryLayers by offering reviews and making edits to StoryLayer geometries and attributes.

This module includes the following lessons:

+	Lesson 1 – Peer Reviewing StoryLayers
+	Lesson 2 – Editing StoryLayer geometries
+	Lesson 3 – Editing StoryLayer attributes

Each lesson is planned to take about XXXX minutes to complete. Combined, this module should take XXX hours to complete (assuming ten minute breaks between each Lesson).


## Lesson 1: Peer Reviewing StoryLayers
##### Objective
In this Lesson, students will learn how to review StoryLayers imported by their peers.
### Lecture

StoryScapes provides a variety of ways to review StoryLayers so that quality and accuracy can be continuously promoted and improved. In this Lesson we will cover the following Peer Review actions:

+ __Flag__ a StoryLayer
+ __Rate__ a StoryLayer
+ __Comment__ on a StoryLayer

##### Flagging a StoryLayer

Flagging a StoryLayer results in a notification being sent to a StoryScapes site Administrator. Administrators have a range of powers. They can deactivate problematic user accounts and unpublish or delete problematic StoryLayers and StoryScapes.

There are five reasons you might want to Flag a StoryLayer:
1. __Broken__: If you try and fail to perform any actions with a StoryLayer, such as playing the StoryLayer, editing the StoryLayer, or using the StoryLayer in a StoryScape), you can flag the StoryLayer as broken.
2. __Inappropriate__: If you see something in a StoryLayer that you feel is inappropriate, Flag it. The StoryLayer will not automatically be unpublished or deleted. An Administrator will determine what action should be taken.
3. __Missing Metadata__: If a StoryLayer lacks key metadata, such as a Data Source or Data Quality Statement, Flag it. An Administrator may respond by unpublishing the StoryLayer until appropriate metadata is added.
4. __Violates Terms__: StoryScapes users must abide by a set of Terms and Conditions XXXX. If you see anything that violates these Terms, Flag it.
5. __Other Issue__: Finally, you are invited to Flag anything else you deem necessary. Just include some text to describe your reasoning.

To submit your Flag, simply click on Flag tool on a StoryLayer page. Select the Flag option you prefer and add any descriptive text that might be helpful. Click Submit.

##### Rating a StoryLayer

Rate a StoryLayer on a five-star scale to communicate your overall feeling about its completeness and accuracy. There is no set rubric for StoryLayer ratings. In general, a rating of 1 means that you find the StoryLayer to be extremely incomplete and/or inaccurate. A 5 means you find the StoryLayer to be extremely complete and/or accurate.

As more and more people rate StoryLayers, the rating becomes a stronger reflection of the general population's true feeling on the StoryLayer.

The 5-star rating is another tool to help Storytellers determine if a StoryLayer is of high enough quality to use in a StoryScape.

To add your rating, simply find the rating tool on a StoryLayer page. Place your mouse on top of the star you'd like to assign, and Click.

##### Commenting on a Storylayer

Add a public Comment to a StoryLayer to communicate a message you feel all StoryScapes users need to be aware of when viewing a StoryLayer. For example, you might:
+ Add a comment describing your positive experience using the StoryLayer as part of a StoryScape
+ Add a comment that lets users know the areas this StoryLayer is in particular need of editing help
+ Add a comment letting users know about another StoryLayer that is complimentary, or that provides a contradictory perspective.

To add your Comment, find the Share tab on a StoryLayer page. Simply type your Comment and click Post.

### Demonstration

Now that you've learned how to peer review a StoryLayer, let's watch an example a user taking action to Peer Review a StoryLayer:

Watch this video. VIDEO.

### Tasks

Now it's your turn! Login to StoryScapes and a find a StoryLayer you would like to Peer Review. Take each of the following actions, and when complete share the link to the StoryLayer with a colleague:

- [x] Add a rating to the StoryLayers
- [x] Make a comment on the StoryLayer
- [x] Submit a flag and note the issue that should be addressed by an Administrator


## Lesson 2: Editing StoryLayer geometries
##### Objective
In this Lesson, students will learn how to add, modify and delete feature geometries in a StoryLayer.

### Lecture

A StoryLayer is like a Wiki article where everyone can improve quality and accuracy through continuous editing. StoryLayer editing lets us draw on the vast knowledge - the "cognitive surplus" - that we all have about various phenomena of change in the world.

StoryLayers are comprised of features. Every feature in a StoryLayer has a geometry and attributes. The geometry determines how the feature appears on the map. Is it a point, line or polygon? And where is it located? The attributes determine the information we have _about_ the feature. For example, if your StoryLayer depicts schools in a town, you might have point geometries for each school location, and attributes for each school's name, student enrollment, grades served and whether the school os public or private.

In StoryScapes, you can edit (i.e. add, modify or delete) both geometry and attribute information for each feature.

#### Editing Feature Geometries

Let's start by learning to edit feature geometries. As we've already said, editing can involve adding new, modifying what exists, and deleting what exists.

##### Adding New Feature Geometries
There are two ways to add new feature geometries to a StoryLayer:
1. By adding one at a time
2. By "appending" a large number of new features at once

_Add one new feature geometry_:

When you want to make any kind of change to a StoryLayer, you begin by clicking "Edit" from the StoryLayer detail page.

![SCREENSHOT](figures/Twopartsofthegeospatialdatamodel.png "Two parts of the geospatial data model")

In the StoryScapes Editor you will see the following buttons on the left-hand side:
+ Add Feature
+ Edit Feature
+ Metadata
+ View Table
+ View history
+ Exit

You can also select a basemap that provides the view on the map that you prefer.

To add one new feature, click Add Feature.





### Demonstration

Now that you've learned how to Edit the geometry of StoryLayer features, let's watch an example of a user performing these actions:

Watch this video. VIDEO.

### Tasks

Now it's your turn! Login to StoryScapes and a find a StoryLayer you would like to Edit. Take each of the following actions, and when complete share the link to the StoryLayer with a colleague:

- [x] Add a new feature to the StoryLayer
- [x] Modify the shape of a feature in a StoryLayer
- [x] Delete a feature in a StoryLayer
